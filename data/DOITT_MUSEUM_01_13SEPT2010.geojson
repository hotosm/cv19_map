This bias especially affects so-called informal neighbourhoods which are characterised by self-constructed housing and infrastructure. In a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts, the different meanings of vulnerabilities and their connections become visible, and resident-led processes of resilience manifest. On the other side of the spectrum, traditional, centralised data providers, such as National Statistics Offices and early warning systems are now with urgency looking for alternative sources to enable the government response to such crises. The aim of this project is to help bringing these two into dialogue through participatory, inclusive and empowering creation of data on vulnerability and factors of resilience. The maps produced here will enable the community-led identification of the most vulnerable households in El Pacífico, which in the first instance will be used to support aid to families in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."}, "geometry":	{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-75.5378810807758, 6.24914729358304]}	},

With more than 24 million people across the country in need of assistance, it remains the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Thousands continue to stream into Marib city and nearby areas in search of safety. Marib made it earn the “city of refugees” title, now hosting 750,000 displaced people. The humanitarian needs are fast accruing and basic services and assistance are overstretched. Many displaced families are now living in overcrowded, makeshift sites with poor access to clean water and sanitation, putting them at heightened risk to a COVID-19 outbreak The data you contribute will support humanitarian organizations to better deliver aid to those more in need"}, "geometry":	{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [44.9238023896894, 15.1305163625714]} }
